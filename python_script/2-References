</div><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The present document defines the
Stage&nbsp;2 service description for the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain -
also known as the Evolved Packet System (EPS) in this document. The Evolved
3GPP Packet Switched Domain provides IP connectivity using the Evolved
Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The specification covers both roaming and
non-roaming scenarios and covers all aspects, including mobility between
E-UTRAN and pre-E-UTRAN 3GPP radio access technologies, policy control and
charging, and authentication.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Radio Access Network functionality is
documented only to the extent necessary to describe the overall system.
TS&nbsp;36.300&nbsp;[5] contains the overall description of the Evolved
Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial
Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>ITU-T Recommendation I.130&nbsp;[3]
describes a three-stage method for characterisation of telecommunication
services, and ITU-T Recommendation Q.65&nbsp;[4] defines Stage&nbsp;2 of the
method.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>TS&nbsp;23.402&nbsp;[2] is a companion
specification to this specification.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>An Evolved Packet System architecture
optimised for the support of Cellular IoT (Internet of Things) applications is
also defined in this document.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Evolved Packet System also provides
support for the E-UTRAN to control a Dual Connectivity radio connection that
uses a combination of E-UTRA and another radio access technology (e.g. NR).
TS&nbsp;36.300&nbsp;[5] contains the overall description for Dual Connectivity.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Enhancements to support interworking of EPS
with 5GS are captured in TS&nbsp;23.501&nbsp;[83] and TS&nbsp;23.502&nbsp;[84].</span></p><div style='mso-element:para-border-div;border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 1.5pt;
