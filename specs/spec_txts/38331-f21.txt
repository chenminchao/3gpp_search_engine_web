4.2  Architecture

Editor's note The state model is still a subject for discussion.FFS


4.2.1  UE states and state transitions including inter RAT

Editor's Note: For EN_DC, only RRC_CONNECTED is applicable.

A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC
connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC
connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can
further be characterised as follows:

-  RRC_IDLE:

-  A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;

-  UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;

-  The UE:

-  Monitors a Paging channel;

-  Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;

-  Acquires system information.

-  RRC_INACTIVE:

-  A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;

-  UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;

-  The UE stores the AS context;

-  The UE:

-  Monitors a Paging channel;

-  Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;

-  Performs RAN-based notification area updates when moving outside the RAN-
based notification area;

Editor's Note: FFS Whether a RAN-based notification area is always
configured or not.

Editor's Note: FFS UE behavior if it is decided that a RAN-based
notification area is not always configured.

-  Acquires system information.

-  RRC_CONNECTED:

-  The UE stores the AS context;

-  Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;

-  At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;

-  For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
SpCell, for increased bandwidth;

-  For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for
increased bandwidth;

-  Network controlled mobility within NR and to/from E-UTRAN;

-  The UE:

-  Monitors a Paging channel;

-  Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;

-  Provides channel quality and feedback information;

-  Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;

-  Acquires system information.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state
transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.

-  Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a terminating call [FFS, for
ETWS, for CMAS];

-  Transfer of dedicated control information, i.e. information for one
specific UE.


4.3.2  Services expected from lower layers

In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower
layers:

-  PDCP: integrity protection, ciphering and in-sequence delivery of
information without duplication [FFS if duplication need to be listed];

-  RLC: reliable transfer of information, without introducing duplicates
and with support for segmentation.


4.4  Functions

The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:

-  Broadcast of system information:

-  Including NAS common information;

-  Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, e.g. cell
(re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information and information
(also) applicable for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, e.g. common channel
configuration information;

5  Procedures


5.1  General


5.1.1  Introduction

This section covers the general requirements.


5.1.2  General requirements

The UE shall:

1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing
of a subsequent message;

NOTE:  Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the
UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.

1> within a sub-clause execute the steps according to the order specified
in the procedural description;

1> consider the term 'radio bearer' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs unless
explicitly stated otherwise;

1> set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the message received from NR that
triggered the response message;

1> upon receiving a choice value set to setup:

2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;

1> upon receiving a choice value set to release:

2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;

1> in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension
field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the
original field (regardless of whether NR signals more entries in total);
apply the following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:

2> create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included
in the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order
among both the original and the additional entries;

2> for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same
behaviour as defined for the original field.


5.2  System information

Editor's Note: Targeted for completion in September2018. For EN_DC, only
parts related to MIB acquisition, in sub-clauses 5.2.2.3.1 and 5.2.2.4.1,
are applicable.


5.2.1  Introduction

System Information (SI) is divided into the MasterInformationBlock (MIB)
and a number of SystemInformationBlocks (SIBs) where:

-  the MasterInformationBlock (MIB) is always transmitted on the BCH with a
periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms [38.212, Section
7.1] and it includes parameters that are needed to acquire
SystemInformationBlockType1 (SIB1) from the cell;

-  the SystemInformationBlockType1 (SIB1) is transmitted on the DL-SCH with
a periodicity of [X] and repetitions made within [X]. SIB1 includes
information regarding the availability and scheduling (e.g. periodicity, SI-
window size) of other SIBs. It also indicates whether they (i.e. other
SIBs) are provided via periodic broadcast basis or only on-demand basis
(refer Figure 5.2.2.X.X FFS_Ref). If other SIBs are provided on-demand then
SIB1 includes information for the UE to perform SI request;

-  SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1 are carried in
SystemInformation (SI) messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Each
SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows
(referred to as SI-windows);

-  For PSCell and SCells, RAN provides the required SI by dedicated
signalling. Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire MIB of the PSCell to get SFN
timing of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of
relevant SI for SCell, RAN releases and adds the concerned SCell. For
PSCell, SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.

Editor's Note: Reference to RAN1 specification may be used for the MIB/SIB1
periodicities [X].FFS


5.2.2  System information acquisition


5.2.2.1  General UE requirements

[pic]

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition

The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS
information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and
in RRC_CONNECTED.

The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of
(at least) the MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1 as well
as SystemInformationBlockTypeX through SystemInformationBlockTypeY
(depending on support of the concerned RATs for UE controlled mobility).

The UE in RRC_CONNECTED shall ensure having a valid version of (at least)
the MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1 as well as
SystemInformationBlockTypeX (depending on support of mobility towards the
concerned RATs).

The UE shall store relevant SI acquired from the currently camped/serving
cell.  A version of the SI that the UE acquires and stores remains valid
only for a certain time. The UE may use such a stored version of the SI
e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after SI
change indication.

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone if the UE is required to store SI other than
for the currently camped/serving cell].

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone if different versions of SIBs are provided].

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone UE may or shall store several versions of
SI].

Editor's Note: FFS_Standalone To be updated when above is resolved. Another
sub-clause under 5.2.2.2 can be considered depending on the resolution of
above.


5.2.2.2  SI validity and need to (re)-acquire SI

The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause
5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return
from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after
entering RAN from another RAT; whenever the UE does not have a valid
version in the stored SI.

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone if upon receiving HO command the SI
acquisition depend on stored SI]

When the UE acquires a MasterInformationBlock or a
SystemInformationBlockType1 or a SI message in a currently camped/serving
cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, the UE shall store the acquired SI.


5.2.2.2.1   SI validity

The UE shall:

1> delete any stored version of SI after [FFS] hours from the moment it was
successfully confirmed as valid;

1> if the UE does not have in the stored SI a valid version for the
required SI corresponding to the systemInfoAreaIdentifier and
systemInfoValueTag/systemInfoConfigurationIndex of that SI in the currently
camped/serving cell:

2> (re)acquire the SI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.

NOTE:  At the SI acquisition procedure, the UE may assume the acquired SI
in the currently camped/serving cell to be valid in other cells than the
currently camped/serving cell based on systemInfoAreaIdentifier and
systemInfoValueTag/systemInfoConfigurationIndex.

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone terminology to be used is systemInfoValueTag
or systemInfoConfigurationIndex]

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone terminology to be used for area ID is
systemInfoAreaIdentifier]

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone whether the area ID and valuetag is
separately signalled or as a single identifier]

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone whether the area ID is associated to each
SIB/SI message or associated to a group of SIBs/SI messages or all SIBs/SI
messages]


5.2.2.2.2   SI change indication and PWS notification

A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI is provided in the
modification period following the one where SI change indication is
transmitted. RAN transmits SI change indication and PWS notification
through paging. Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within
preceding modification period.

Editor's Note : The above descriptive text can remain in this sub-clause or
moved under 5.2.1. FFS_Standalone

If the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED or is configured to use a DRX cycle smaller
than the modification period in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE and receives a
Paging message:

1> if the received Paging message includes the etws/cmasNotification;

2> the UE shall immediately re-acquire the SIB1 and apply the SI
acquisition procedure as defined in sub-clause [X.X.X.X FFS_Ref];

1> else, if the received Paging message includes the
systemInfoModification;

2> the UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in sub-clause
[X.X.X.X FFS_Ref] from the start of the next modification period.

NOTE For PWS notification the SIB1 is re-acquired to know the scheduling
information for the PWS messages.

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone if upon receiving a SI change indication the
SI acquisition depend on stored SI]

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone if value tags and area identifier included
in paging message to reacquire SIB1]

Editor's Note: [FFS_Standalone the update mechanism for access control
notifications and other non-access control configuration updates]

Editor's Note: [FFS_StandaloneWhether to make a generic bit to indicate
immediate acquisition of SI will be considered after AC discussion has
progressed]

5.3.5  RRC reconfiguration


5.3.5.1  General

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/modify/release RBs, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to
setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell
groups. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be
transferred from the Network to the UE.

In EN-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and reportingto
(re-)configure MAC, RLC, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of the
SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the S-
KgNB or SRB3, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any
MeNB involvement.


5.3.5.2  Initiation

The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:

-  the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during
RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been
activated;

-  the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when
AS security has been activated;

-  the reconfigurationWithSync is included in secondaryCellGroup only when
at least one DRB is setup in SCG.


5.3.5.3  Reception of an RRCReconfiguration by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the
RRCReconfiguration:

1> if the RRCReconfiguration includes the secondaryCellGroup:

2> perform the cell group configuration for the SCG according to 5.3.5.5;

1> if the RRCReconfiguration message contains the radioBearerConfig:

2> perform the radio bearer configuration according to 5.3.5.6;

1> if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the measConfig:

2> perform the measurement configuration procedure as specified in 5.5.2;

1>  if the UE is configured with E-UTRA nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig (MCG is
E-UTRA):

2> if RRCReconfiguration was received via SRB1:

3> construct RRCReconfigurationComplete message and submit it via the EUTRA
MCG embedded in E-UTRA RRC message RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete as
specified in TS 36.331 [10];

3> if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG:

4> initiate the random access procedure on the SpCell, as specified in TS
38.321 [3];

3> else:

4>  the procedure ends;

NOTE:  The order the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete
message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is left to
UE implementation.

2> else (RRCReconfiguration was received via SRB3):

3> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB3 to lower layers
for transmission using the new configuration;

NOTE:  In the case of SRB1, the random access is triggered by RRC layer
itself as there is not necessarily other UL transmission. In the case of
SRB3, the random access is triggered by the MAC layer due to arrival of
RRCReconfigurationComplete.

1>  if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG, and
when MAC of an NR cell group successfully completes a random access
procedure triggered above;

2>  stop timer T304 for that cell group;

2>  apply the parts of the CQI reporting configuration, the scheduling
request configuration and the sounding RS configuration that do not require
the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell, if any;

2>  apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource configuration
that require the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell (e.g.
measurement gaps, periodic CQI reporting, scheduling request configuration,
sounding RS configuration), if any, upon acquiring the SFN of that target
SpCell;

2>  the procedure ends.


5.3.5.4  Secondary cell group release

The UE shall:

1> as a result of SCG release triggered by E-UTRA:

2> reset SCG MAC, if configured;

2> for each RLC bearer that is part of the SCG configuration:

3> perform RLC bearer release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.5.3;

2> release the SCG configuration;

2> stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;

2> stop timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell, if running.

NOTE:  Release of cell group means only release of the lower layer
configuration of the cell group but the RadioBearerConfig may not be
released.


5.3.5.5  Cell Group configuration


5.3.5.5.1   General

The network configures the UE with one Secondary Cell Group (SCG). For EN-
DC, the MCG is configured as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. The network
provides the configuration parameters for a cell group in the
CellGroupConfig IE.

The UE performs the following actions based on a received CellGroupConfig
IE:

1> start timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell with the timer value set
to t304, as included in the reconfigurationWithSync;

1> if the frequencyInfoDL is included:

2> consider the target SpCell to be one on the frequency indicated by the
frequencyInfoDL with a physical cell identity indicated by the physCellId;

1> else:

2> consider the target SpCell to be one on the frequency of the source
SpCell with a physical cell identity indicated by the physCellId;

1> start synchronising to the DL of the target SpCell and acquire the MIB
of the target SpCell as specified in 5.2.2.3.1;

NOTE:  The UE should perform the reconfiguration with sync as soon as
possible following the reception of the RRC message triggering the
reconfiguration with sync, which could be before confirming successful
reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.

1> reset the MAC entity of this cell group;

1> consider the SCell(s) of this cell group, if configured, to be in
deactivated state;

3> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];

2> reconfigure the RLC entity or entities in accordance with the received
rlc-Config;

2> reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received mac-
LogicalChannelConfig;

NOTE:  The network does not re-associate an already configured logical
channel with another radio bearer. Hence servedRadioBearer is not present
in this case.

1> else (a logical channel with the given logicalChannelIdentity was not
configured before):

2> if the logicalChannelIdentity corresponds to an SRB and rlc-Config is
not included:

3> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the default configuration
defined in 9.2 for the corresponding SRB;

5.3.5.6.4   DRB release

Editor's Note: FFS / TODO: Add handling for the new QoS concept (mapping of
flows; configuration of QFI-to-DRB mapping; reflective QoS...) but keep
also EPS-Bearer handling for the EN-DC case

The UE shall:

1> for each drb-Identity value included in the drb-ToReleaseList that is
part of the current UE configuration (DRB release):

2> release the PDCP entity;

1> if a new bearer is not added either with NR or E-UTRA  with same eps-
BearerIdentity:

2> if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:

3> indicate the release of the DRB and the eps-BearerIdentity of the
released DRB to upper layers after successful reconfiguration with sync;

2> else:

3> indicate the release of the DRB and the eps-BearerIdentity of the
released DRB to upper layers immediately.

NOTE 1:  The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the drb-
ToReleaseList includes any drb-Identity value that is not part of the
current UE configuration.

NOTE 2:  Whether or not the RLC and MAC entities associated with this PDCP
entity are reset or released is determined by the CellGroupConfig.


5.3.5.6.5   DRB addition/modification

The UE shall:

1> for each drb-Identity value included in the drb-ToAddModList that is not
part of the current UE configuration (DRB establishment including the case
when full configuration option is used):

2> establish a PDCP entity and configure it in accordance with the received
pdcp-Config;

2> configure the PDCP entity with the security algorithms according to
securityConfig and apply the keys (KUPenc) associated with the KeNB/S-KgNB
as indicated in keyToUse;

2> if the DRB was configured with the same eps-BearerIdentity either by NR
or E-UTRA prior to receiving this reconfiguration:

3> associate the established DRB with the corresponding eps-BearerIdentity;

2> else:

3> indicate the establishment of the DRB(s) and the eps-BearerIdentity of
the established DRB(s) to upper layers;

1> for each drb-Identity value included in the drb-ToAddModList that is
part of the current UE configuration:

2> if reestablishPDCP is set:

3> configure the PDCP entity of this RadioBearerConfig to apply the
ciphering algorithm and KUPenc key associated with the KeNB/S-KgNB as
indicated in keyToUse, i.e. the ciphering configuration shall be applied to
all subsequent PDCP PDUs received and sent by the UE;

3> re-establish the PDCP entity of this DRB as specified in 38.323 [5],
section 5.1.2;

2> else, if recoverPDCP is set:

3> trigger the PDCP entity of this DRB to perform data recovery as
specified in 38.323;

2> if the pdcp-Config is included:

3> reconfigure the PDCP entity in accordance with the received pdcp-Config.

NOTE 1:  Removal and addition of the same drb-Identity in a single
radioResourceConfig is not supported. In case drb-Identity is removed and
added due to reconfiguration with sync or re-establishment with the full
configuration option, the network can use the same value of drb-Identity.

NOTE 2:  When determining whether a drb-Identity value is part of the
current UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which
RadioBearerConfig and DRB-ToAddModList that DRB was originally configured
in.  To re-associate a DRB with a different key (KeNB to S-KeNB or vice
versa), the network provides the drb-Identity value in the (target) drb-
ToAddModList and sets the reestablishPDCP flag. The network does not list
the drb-Identity in the (source) drb-ToReleaseList.

NOTE 3:  When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the
network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs
to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a
reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or
by releasing the old RLC entity.

NOTE 4:  In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.


5.3.5.7  Security key update

Upon reception of sk-Counter as specified in TS 36.331 [10] the UE shall:

1> update the S-KgNB key based on the KeNB key and using the received sk-
Counter value, as specified in TS 33.501 [11];

1> derive KRRCenc and KUPenc key as specified in TS 33.501 [11];

1> derive the KRRCint and KUPint key as specified in TS 33.501 [11].

The UE shall:

1> upon integrity check failure indication from NR lower layers for SRB3:

2> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in subclause
5.7.3 to report SRB3 integrity check failure.


5.3.5.8.2   Inability to comply with RRCReconfiguration

The UE shall:

1> if the UE is operating in EN-DC:

2> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included
in the RRCReconfiguration message received over SRB3;

3> continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of
RRCReconfiguration message;

3> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in subclause
5.7.3 to report SCG reconfiguration error, upon which the connection
reconfiguration procedure ends;

2> else, if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration
included in the RRCReconfiguration message received over MCG SRB1;

3> continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of
RRCReconfiguration message;

3> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS
36.331 [10, 5.3.7], upon which the connection reconfiguration procedure
ends.

NOTE 1:  The UE may apply above failure handling also in case the
RRCReconfiguration message causes a protocol error for which the generic
error handling as defined in 10 specifies that the UE shall ignore the
message.

NOTE 2:  If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it
does not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial
success/failure.


5.3.5.8.3   T304 expiry (Reconfiguration with sync Failure)

The UE shall:

1> if T304 of a secondary cell group expires:

2>  release rach-ContentionFree;

2> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in subclause
5.7.3 to report SCG reconfiguration with sync failure, upon which the RRC
reconfiguration procedure ends.

5.5  Measurements


5.5.1  Introduction

The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements and
report them in accordance with the measurement configuration. The
measurement configuration is provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e.
using the RRCReconfiguration.

The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements:

-  NR measurements;

-  Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on SS/PBCH block(s):

-  Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;

-  Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);

-  SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on CSI-RS resources:

-  Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;

-  Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);

-  CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.

The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:

1. Measurement objects: A list of objects on which the UE shall perform the
measurements.

-  For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement
object indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of
reference signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object,
the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of
'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells
are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or
measurement reporting.

-  The measObjectId  of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is
indicated by servingCellMO within the serving cell configuration.

-  For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single EUTRA
carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the
network can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of
'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells
are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or
measurement reporting.

2. Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where there
can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object.
Each reporting configuration consists of the following:

-  Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description;.

-  RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results
(SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).

-  Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE
includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated
information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number
beams per cell to report.

3. Measurement identities: A list of measurement identities where each
measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting
configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities, it is
possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting
configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to
the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also included in
the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference
to the network.

4. Quantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the
measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and
related reporting of that measurement type. For NR measurements, the
network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a reference in
the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be used. In each
configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for
different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for
measurements per cell and per beam.

5. Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements,
i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.

A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting
configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to
signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object
list possibly includes NR intra-frequency object(s), NR inter-frequency
object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration
list includes NR and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement
object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type.
Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object.
Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting
configuration.

The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:

1. The NR serving cell(s) - these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.

2. Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).

3. Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies)
and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).

For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving
cell(s), listed cells and/or detected cells.

Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause
5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig
unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration
procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.

5.5.3  Performing measurements


5.5.3.1  General

An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one
or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as
described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED the
UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the
measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria and measurement
reporting. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ or
SINR as trigger quantity. Reporting quantities can be the same as trigger
quantity or combinations of quantities (i.e. RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR;
RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR).

The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per
beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam
identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in
5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in
measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified
in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact layer 1 filtering of beam
measurements used to derive cell measurement results is implementation
dependent.

The UE shall:

1> whenever the UE has a measConfig, perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements for
each serving cell for which servingCellMO is configured as as follows:

2> if at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig
contains an rsType set to ssb:

3> if at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig
contains a reportQuantityRsIndexes and maxNrofRSIndexesToReport:

4> derive layer 3 filtered RSRP and RSRQ per beam for the serving cell
based on SS/PBCH block, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3> derive serving cell measurement results based on SS/PBCH block, as
described in 5.5.3.3;

2> if at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig
contains an rsType set to csi-rs:

3> if at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig
contains a reportQuantityRsIndexes and maxNrofRSIndexesToReport:

4> derive layer 3 filtered RSRP and RSRQ per beam for the serving cell
based on CSI-RS, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3> derive serving cell measurement results based on CSI-RS, as described in
5.5.3.3;

1> if at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig
contains SINR as trigger quantity and/or reporting quantity:

2> if the associated reportConfig contains rsType set to ssb:

3> if the measId contains a reportQuantityRsIndexes and
maxNrofRSIndexesToReport:

4> derive layer 3 filtered SINR per beam for the serving cell based on
SS/PBCH block, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3> derive serving cell SINR based on SS/PBCH block, as described in
5.5.3.3;

2> if the associated reportConfig contains rsType set to csi-rs:

3> if the measId contains a reportQuantityRsIndexes and
maxNrofRSIndexesToReport:

4> derive layer 3 filtered SINR per beam for the serving cell based on CSI-
RS, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3> derive serving cell SINR based on CSI-RS, as described in 5.5.3.3;

1> for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:

2> if the reportType for the associated reportConfig is periodical or
eventTriggered:

3> if a measurement gap configuration is setup, or

3> if the UE does not require measurement gaps to perform the concerned
measurements:

4> if s-MeasureConfig is not configured, or

4> if s-MeasureConfig is set to ssb-RSRP and the NR SpCell RSRP based on
SS/PBCH block, after layer 3 filtering, is lower than ssb-RSRP,or

4> if s-MeasureConfig is set to csi-RSRP and the NR SpCell RSRP based on
CSI-RS, after layer 3 filtering, is lower than csi-RSRP:

5> if the measObject is associated to NR and the rsType is set to csi-rs:

6> if reportQuantityRsIndexes and maxNrofRSIndexesToReport for the
associated reportConfig are configured:

7> derive layer 3 filtered beam measurements only based on CSI-RS for each
measurement quantity indicated in reportQuantityRsIndexes, as described in
5.5.3.3a;

6> derive cell measurement results based on CSI-RS for each trigger
quantity and each measurement quantity indicated in reportQuantityCell
using parameters from the associated measObject, as described in 5.5.3.3;

5> if the measObject is associated to NR and the rsType is set to ssb:

6> if reportQuantityRsIndexes and maxNrofRSIndexesToReport for the
associated reportConfig are configured:

7> derive layer 3 beam measurements only based on SS/PBCH block for each
measurement quantity indicated in reportQuantityRsIndexes, as described in
5.5.3.3a;

6> derive cell measurement results based on SS/PBCH block for each trigger
quantity and each measurement quantity indicated in reportQuantityCell
using parameters from the associated measObject, as described in 5.5.3.3;

5> if the measObject is associated to E-UTRA:

6> perform the corresponding measurements associated to neighbouring cells
on the frequencies indicated in the concerned measObject;

2> perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in 5.5.4.


5.5.3.2  Layer 3 filtering

The UE shall:

1> for each cell measurement quantity and for each beam measurement
quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1:

2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:

   [pic]

   where

Mn is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;

Fn is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for evaluation
of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;

Fn-1is the old filtered measurement result, where F0is set to M1 when the
first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and

a = 1/2(k/4), where k is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding
measurement quantity received by the quantityConfig;

2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficient k
assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of X is equivalent to one
intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in 38.331 [14] assuming
non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.

NOTE 1:  If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.

NOTE 2:  The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for
evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e.,
logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.

NOTE 3:  The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in TS 38.133[14]. For further details about
the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].


5.5.3.3  Derivation of cell measurement results

The network may configure the UE to derive RSRP, RSRQ and SINR measurement
results per cell associated to NR measurement objects based on parameters
configured in the measObject (e.g. maximum number of beams to be averaged
and beam consolidation thresholds) and in the reportConfig (rsType to be
measured, SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).

The UE shall:

1> for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on SS/PBCH block:

2> if nrofSS-BlocksToAverage in the associated measObject is not
configured; or

2> if absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation in the associated measObject is not
configured; or

BlocksConsolidation:

3> derive each cell measurement quantity based on SS/PBCH block as the
highest beam measurement quantity value, where each beam measurement
quantity is described in TS 38.215 [9];

2> else:

3> derive each cell measurement quantity based on SS/PBCH block as the
linear average of the power values of the highest beam measurement quantity
values above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation where the total number of
averaged beams shall not exceed nrofSS-BlocksToAverage;

2> apply layer 3 cell filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;

1> for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on CSI-RS:

2> consider a CSI-RS resource to be applicable for deriving cell
measurements when the concerned CSI-RS resource is included in the csi-rs-
ResourceCellMobility including the physCellId of the cell in the CSI-RS-
ConfigMobility in the associated measObject;

2> if nrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage in the associated measObject is not

6  Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)


6.1  General


6.1.1  Introduction

The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1
to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide
further detailed information about the fields specified in the message
syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-
alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause
6.3.


6.1.2  Need codes and conditions for optional downlink fields

The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e.,
the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation
(ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the
OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are
available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag
is specified in table 6.1.2-1.

If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the
message or information element specifying the need of the field for each
condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases
the value in case the field is not present. The conditions clarify what the
UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network.
Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour, which the
UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined
in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory
according to the CondC or CondM condition.

For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and
A.7.

Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields
to be present

–  BWP

The BWP IE is used to configure a bandwidth part as defined in 38.211,
section 4.2.2.

For each serving cell the network configures at least an initial bandwidth
part comprising of at least a downlink bandwidth part and one (if the
serving cell is configured with an uplink) or two (if using supplementary
uplink (SUL)) uplink bandwidth parts. Furthermore, the network may
configure additional uplink and downlink bandwidth parts for a serving
cell.

The bandwidth part configuration is split into uplink and downlink
parameters and into common and dedicated parameters. Common parameters (in
BWP-UplinkCommon and BWP-DownlinkCommon) are "cell specific" and the
network ensures the necessary alignment with corresponding parameters of
other UEs. The common parameters of the initial bandwidth part of the PCell
are also provided via system information. For all other serving cells, the
network provides the common parameters via dedicated signalling.

|Frequency domain location and bandwidth of this bandwidth part. The value of the field shall be interpreted as|

|i.e. setting [pic]=275. The first PRB is a PRB determined by subcarrierSpacing of this BWP and offsetToCarrier|
|(configured in SCS-SpecificCarrier contained within FrequencyInfoDL) corresponding to this subcarrier spacing.|
|In case of TDD, a BWP-pair (UL BWP and DL BWP with the same bwp-Id) must have the same center frequency (see  |

–  CellGroupConfig

The CellGroupConfig IE is used to configure a master cell group (MCG) or
secondary cell group (SCG). A cell group comprises of one MAC entity, a set
of logical channels with associated RLC entities and of a primary cell
(SpCell) and one or more secondary cells (SCells).

–  ControlResourceSetId

The ControlResourceSetId IE concerns a short identity, used to identify a
control resource set within a serving cell. The ControlResourceSetId = 0
identifies the ControlResourceSet configured via PBCH (MIB) and in
ServingCellConfigCommon. The ID space is used across the BWPs of a Serving
Cell. The number of CORESETs per BWP is limited to 3 (including the initial
CORESET).

–  CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList

The CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList IE is used to configure the UE with a
list of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field "CSI
request" is associated with one trigger state. Upon reception of the value
associated with a trigger state, the UE will perform measurement of
aperiodic CSI-RS (reference signals) and aperiodic reporting on L1
according to all entries in the associatedReportConfigInfoList for that
trigger state.

–  CSI-ReportConfig

The IE CSI-ReportConfig is used to configure a periodic or semi-persistent
report sent on PUCCH on the cell in which the CSI-ReportConfig is included,
or to configure a semi-persistent or aperiodic report sent on PUSCH
triggered by DCI received on the cell in which the CSI-ReportConfig is
included (in this case, the cell on which the report is sent is determined
by the received DCI). See 38.214, section 5.2.1.

–  PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList

The IE PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time
domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The PDSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList contains one or more of such PDSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocations.  The network indicates in the DL assignment
which of the configued time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that
DL assignment. The UE determines the bit width of the DCI field based on
the number of entries in the PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. Value
0 in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list, value 1 in the
DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.

The IE PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time
domain relation between PDCCH and PUSCH. PUSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList contains one or more of such PUSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocations. The network indicates in the UL grant which
of the configued time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that UL
grant. The UE determines the bit width of the DCI field based on the number
of entries in the PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. Value 0 in the
DCI field refers to the first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI
field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.

|A list of reference signals for detecting beam failure and/or cell level radio link failure (RLF). The network|
|configures at most two detectionResources per BWP for the purpose "beamFailure" or "both". If no RSs are      |

|TCI-State for PDCCH. However, if the activated TCI state refers to an aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS, the|
|gNB configures the failure detection resources explicitly (FFS_RAN1: TBC by RAN1). If no RSs are provided in  |
|this list at all (neither for Cell- nor for Beam-RLM), the UE performs also Cell-RLM based on the activated   |
|TCI-State of PDCCH (FFS_RAN1: TBC by RAN1). When the RS(s) for RLF is reconfigured by the network, the UE     |
|resets T310 and the counters related to N310 and N311. When the RS(s) for beam failure detection (BFD) is     |

measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH block or
CSI-RS. These events are labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and so on.

Event A1:   Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;

Event A2:   Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;

Event A3:   Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;

Event A4:   Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;

–  ServingCellConfigCommon

The ServingCellConfigCommon IE is used to configure cell specific
parameters of a UE's serving cell. The IE contains parameters which a UE
would typically acquire from SSB, MIB or SIBs when accessing the cell from
IDLE. With this IE, the network provides this information in dedicated
signalling when configuring a UE with a SCells or with an additional cell
group (SCG). It also provides it for SpCells (MCG and SCG) upon
reconfiguration with sync.

–  SPS-Config

Editor's Note: FFS: RAN1 indicated in the L1 table: "Note: Multiple
configurations is possible, how many needs to be determined". RAN2 agreed
that SPS can be used on Pcell and SCell... But each UE can use it on at
most one serving cell of a cell group at a time. Are the ”multiple
configuration” meant for one carrier? Does the UE then use several SPS-
RNTIs?

The SPS-Config IE is used to configure downlink semi-persistent
transmission. Downlink SPS may be configured on the PCell as well as on
SCells. But it shall not be configured for more than one serving cell of a
cell group at once.

–  FeatureSetCombination

The IE FeatureSetCombination is a two dimensional matrix of FeatureSet
entries.

Each FeatureSetsPerBand contains a list of feature sets applicable to the
carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the
associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of FeatureSets at
the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand. All FeatureSetsPerBand in one
FeatureSetCombination must have the same number of entries.

The number of FeatureSetsPerBand in the FeatureSetCombination must be equal
to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The first
FeatureSetPerBand applies to the first band entry of the band combination,
and so on.

Each FeatureSet contains either a pair of NR- or EUTRA feature set IDs for
UL and DL.

In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the
FeatureSets IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position
in the featureSetsUplink / featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSet IE.

In case of EUTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined
in TS 36.331 and conveyed as part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability container. The
FeatureSetUL-Id-r15 and FeatureSetDL-Id-r15 in the EUTRA feature sets
correspond to the FeatureSetEUTRA-DownlinkId and FeatureSetEUTRA-UplinkId,
respectively.

The FeatureSetUplink and FeatureSetDownlink referred to from the FeatureSet
comprise, among other information, a set of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id:s and
FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id:s. The number of these per-CC IDs determines the
number of carriers that the UE is able to aggregate contiguously in
frequency domain in the corresponding band. The number of FeatureSetUplink-
Id:s/DownlinkPerCC-Id:s shall not exceed the number of carrier supported
according to the BWC indicated in the associated BandCombination, if
present.

8  Protocol data unit abstract syntax


8.1  General

The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract
syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681
[7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions
by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691
[8].

The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified
in X.691:

-  When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to
15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in
the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string
value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;

NOTE:  The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string
value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on
the right.

-  When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint
("CONTAINING"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be
performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not
cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended
that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET
STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the
contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a
separate step;

-  When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a
Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are
extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU,
BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.




8.2  Structure of encoded RRC messages

An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer
entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as
defined in X.691.

RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC
SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as
follows:

-  when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the
first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and

-  when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the
first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and

-  upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the
PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and

-  upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the
RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.


8.3  Basic production

The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the
abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It
always contains a multiple of 8 bits.


8.4  Extension

The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:

-  A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the
extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send
non-empty extensions;

-  A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set
spare bits to zero.


8.5  Padding

If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer
shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.

Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple
of 8.

10 Generic error handling


10.1 General

The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies
unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific
error handling.

The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:

-  to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE;

-  to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned
spare/reserved value.

The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:

-  as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.


10.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error

The UE shall:

1> when receiving an RRC message on the [BCCH] for which the abstract
syntax is invalid [6]:

2> ignore the message.

NOTE:  This section applies in case one or more fields is set to a value,
other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version
of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a
field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be
possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error
handling is at the message level.


10.3 Field set to a not comprehended value

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:

1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:

2> if a default value is defined for this field:

3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;

2> else if the concerned field is optional:

3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;

2> else:

3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-
clause 10.4.


10.4 Mandatory field missing

The UE shall:

1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the
message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and
that field is absent or treated as absent:

2> if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:

3> ignore the message;

2> else:

3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a
SEQUENCE OF):

4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was not present;

3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as
the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to
the erroneous field:

4> consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;

4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;

3> else (field at message level):

4> ignore the message.

NOTE 1:  The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the
UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not
comprehended value.

NOTE 2:  The nested error handling for messages received on logical
channels other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also,
even for errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the
network not observing conditional presence.

The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of
nested error handling for errors in extension fields.

-- /example/ ASN1START

-- Example with extension addition group

ItemInfoList ::=           SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OF ItemInfo

ItemInfo ::=             SEQUENCE {
   itemIdentity            INTEGER (1..max),
   field1                  Field1,
   field2                  Field2          OPTIONAL,      -- Need N
   ...
   [[  field3-r9             Field3-r9         OPTIONAL,       -- Cond
Cond1
     field4-r9             Field4-r9         OPTIONAL     -- Need N
   ]]
}

-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)

BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::=         SEQUENCE {
   itemIdentity            INTEGER (1..max),
   field1                  Field1,
   field2                  Field2          OPTIONAL,      -- Need N
   nonCriticalExtension         BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs   OPTIONAL
}

BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::= SEQUENCE {
   field3-r9               Field3-r9         OPTIONAL,      -- Cond Cond1
   field4-r9               Field4-r9         OPTIONAL,      -- Need N
   nonCriticalExtension         SEQUENCE {}         OPTIONAL       -- Need
S
}

-- ASN1STOP


The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels
applicable in case of nested error handling:

-  an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g.
in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality
of field3 would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather
than just the extension addition group containing field3 and field4);

-  a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its
own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the
conditionality of field3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlock1 to
be ignored (rather than just the non critical extension containing field3
and field4).


10.5 Not comprehended field

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:

1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:

2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.

NOTE:  This section does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
section 10.3.


11 Radio information related interactions between network nodes


11.1 General

This section specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network
nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another
Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar
characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR
radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension
mechanisms apply.


11.2 Inter-node RRC messages


11.2.1 General

This section specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn-
 or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single 'logical
channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The
information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

–  MeasurementTimingConfiguration

Editor's Note: Targeted for completion in Sept 2018. Usage and Direction
need further RAN2 discussions.

The MeasurementTimingConfiguration message is used to convey assistance
information for measurement timing betwen master eNB and secondary gNB.

Direction: Secondary gNB to Master eNB, alternatively gNB DU to gNB CU, and
gNB CU to gNB DU.

         12 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures

The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in
[ms] from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE
physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink
grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other
than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the
random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation).

Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1


A.1  Introduction

The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC
protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.


A.2  Procedural specification


A.2.1  General principles

The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.

It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the
reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the
PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific
details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this
should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU
section e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the
value of multiple fields.

Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the
network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.


A.2.2  More detailed aspects

The following more detailed conventions should be used:

-  Bullets:

-  Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'

-  All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a
semi-colon i.e. an ';.

-  Conditions:

-  Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the
end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if
cond1, or cond2.


A.3  PDU specification


A.3.1  General principles


A.3.1.1  ASN.1 sections

The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].

The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with the following:

-  a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
"ASN1START" (in all upper case letters);

-  a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a block start tag is
included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and
the text string "TAG-NAME-START" (in all upper case letters), where the
"NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case
letters).

Similarly, each ASN.1 section ends with the following:

-  a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a block stop tag, which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
"TAG-NAME-STOP" (in all upper-case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the
main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);

-  a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text
"ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters).

This results in the following tags:

-- ASN1START
-- TAG-NAME-START

-- TAG-NAME-STOP
-- ASN1STOP


The text paragraphs containing either of thestart and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC
PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the
text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag
in the order they appear, throughout the specification.

NOTE:  A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code
consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description
(ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII)
file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes
place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.


A.3.1.2  ASN.1 identifier naming conventions

The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers)
should be based on the following guidelines:

-  Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand,
should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviations should be
avoided in these identifiers and abbreviated forms of these identifiers
should not be used.

-  Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed
case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent
letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-
PLMN, since the "d" in "Selected" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and
MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.

-  Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an
acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a
hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent
search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.

-  Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid
adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like 'Info') for the name.

-  Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.

-  Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters
should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations,
which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of
'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.

-  For future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the
form "-rX" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or
types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the
original/first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or
types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a
previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo.
A suffix of the form "-rXb" is used for the first revision of a field that
it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, "-
rXc" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form "-
vXYZ" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a
corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-
v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version
10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to
represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of
the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the
second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9.
In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in
headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish
the extension from the original field.

-  More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different
variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of
the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is
included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used.
This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the
same for the different variants.

-  It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within
the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to
avoid certain compiler errors).

Table A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1
identifiers

NOTE:  The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations
may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.


A.3.1.3  Text references using ASN.1 identifiers

A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of
the specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the
referenced type. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text
references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling
and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., " ")
should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.

A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1
field identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the
RRCRelease message.

A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the
prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.

-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=     SEQUENCE {
   ul-SpecificParameters        SEQUENCE {
     priority              Priority,
     prioritisedBitRate           PrioritisedBitRate,
     bucketSizeDuration           BucketSizeDuration,
     logicalChannelGroup          INTEGER (0..3)
   }   OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP


NOTE:  All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in
this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not
to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is
extracted from the specification.

A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using
the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g.,
a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.

References to a specific type of information element should only be used
when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context
wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference
is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein
the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that
context should be used in the text reference.

A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1
value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.


A.3.2  High-level message structure

Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types
are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.

-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
   message          DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
   c1             CHOICE {
     dlInformationTransfer          DLInformationTransfer,
     handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest
HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
     mobilityFromEUTRACommand         MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
     rrcConnectionReconfiguration     RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
     rrcConnectionRelease           RRCConnectionRelease,
     securityModeCommand            SecurityModeCommand,
     ueCapabilityEnquiry            UECapabilityEnquiry,
     spare1 NULL
   },
   messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP


A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU
types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.

Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the
c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).

Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated
using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.


A.3.3  Message definition

Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one
shown in the example below.

-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=  SEQUENCE {
   rrc-TransactionIdentifier      RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
   criticalExtensions           CHOICE {
     c1                    CHOICE{
       rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8     RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-
IEs,
       spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
     },
     criticalExtensionsFuture       SEQUENCE {}
   }
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   -- Enter the IEs here.
   ...
}

-- ASN1STOP


Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further
described in sub-clause A.4.

Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement
between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is
prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which
is not comprehended by the decoder.

Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in
this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in
the future releases of the protocol.

Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.

In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future
releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare
alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.

-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
   rrc-TransactionIdentifier      RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
   criticalExtensions           CHOICE {
     rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
                         RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
     criticalExtensionsFuture       SEQUENCE {}
   }
}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   -- Enter the fields here.
   ...
}

-- ASN1STOP


Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new
information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not
comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder,
whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the
comprehended parts of the PDU contents.

Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.

Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an
empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following
example:

-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=           SEQUENCE {
   field1                    InformationElement1,
   field2                    InformationElement2,

   nonCriticalExtension           SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP


The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by
a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the
semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of
this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is
absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to
be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an
IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the
use of this IE that needs to be specified.

|%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions                                                                      |
|%field identifier%                                                                                           |
|Field description.                                                                                           |
|%field identifier%                                                                                           |
|Field description.                                                                                           |


The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain
the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.

The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font
style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following
paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g.,
semantic description, references to other specifications and/or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.

The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall
be omitted from the field description table.


A.3.4  Information elements

Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar
to the one shown in the example below.

-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::=          SEQUENCE {
   rootSequenceIndex            INTEGER (0..1023),
   prach-ConfigInfo          PRACH-ConfigInfo
}

PRACH-Config ::=           SEQUENCE {
   rootSequenceIndex            INTEGER (0..1023),
   prach-ConfigInfo          PRACH-ConfigInfo           OPTIONAL -- Need N
}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::=         SEQUENCE {
   prach-ConfigIndex            ENUMERATED {ffs},
   highSpeedFlag             ENUMERATED {ffs},
   zeroCorrelationZoneConfig      ENUMERATED {ffs}
}

-- ASN1STOP


IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the
same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to
break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.

A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-
ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together
in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have
a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be
complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-
Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB"
suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and
generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way
should use the generic type identifier.

The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version,
of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the
protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version,
of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A
suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions
defined in sub-clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the
where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.

Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other
IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE
types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be
a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as
these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent
data elements, to be used in the software implementation.

An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC
specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1
section should be defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading
and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely related
IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example
above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.

NOTE:  Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the
IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an
outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in
the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a
further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the
information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as
indicated in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The
general format of the field description table is the same as shown in sub-
clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.


A.3.5  Fields with optional presence

A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:

-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=           SEQUENCE {
   numberOfRA-Preambles         INTEGER (1..64)             DEFAULT 1,
   ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the
keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted.
The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of
the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=         SEQUENCE {
   rootSequenceIndex            INTEGER (0..1023),
   prach-ConfigInfo          PRACH-ConfigInfo           OPTIONAL -- Need N
}

-- ASN1STOP


The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code
includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics
tags (S, M, N or R) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is
used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the
field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.

The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the
following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE,
then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one
field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group
level.


A.3.6  Fields with conditional presence

A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the
paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the
keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL"
in this example):

-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=     SEQUENCE {
   ul-SpecificParameters        SEQUENCE {
     priority              INTEGER (0),
     ...
   }   OPTIONAL                                     -- Cond UL
}

-- ASN1STOP


When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the
field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a
conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the
conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the
particular ASN.1 section.

|Conditional      |Explanation                                                                                 |
|presence         |                                                                                            |
|UL               |Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = |
|                 |"UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.|


The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
"Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an
entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a
text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of
the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an
optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the
same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.

Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field
depends on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same
message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another
feature/function has been configured, while this function can be configured
independently e.g. by another message and/or at another point in time, the
relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description
table.

If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence,
the conditional presence table shall not be included.

Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.


A.3.7  Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type

Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF
construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE
data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements
even if it would not otherwise be needed.

For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as
in the following example:

-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::=         SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-
IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::=        SEQUENCE {
   plmn-Identity             PLMN-Identity,
   cellReservedForOperatorUse       ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP


rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated
code to contain types with unpredictable names:

-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=           SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
   plmn-Identity                PLMN-Identity,
   cellReservedForOperatorUse         ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP



A.3.8  Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type

The usage of the parameterised SetupRelease type is like a function call in
programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a
parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract
syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the
compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown
below:

-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   field-r15        SetupRelease { IE-r15 }           OPTIONAL,  --  Need M
   ...
}


RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   field-r15    SetupRelease { Element-r15 }
}                                     OPTIONAL,  -- Need M

Element-r15 ::= SEQUENCE {
   field1-r15          IE1-r15,
   field2-r15          IE2-r15                 OPTIONAL -- Need N
}                                     OPTIONAL,  -- Need M

-- /example/ ASN1STOP


The SetupRelease is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example
below is not allowed:

-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   field-r15    SetupRelease { SEQUENCE {  -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not
allowed!
       field1-r15          IE1-r15,
       field2-r15          IE2-r15               OPTIONAL -- Need N
     }
   }                                    OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
}

-- /example/ ASN1STOP


If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires
procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the
type itself, namely, "setup" and "release". For example, procedural text
for field-r15 above could be as follows:

1> if field-r15 is set to "setup":

2> do something;

1> else (field-r15 is set to "release"):

2> release field-r15 (if appropriate).


A.3.9  Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList

In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many
and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be
used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the
ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements
that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list
conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be
released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to
signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the
UE). An example is provided below:

-- /example/ ASN1START

AnExampleIE ::=     SEQUENCE {
   elementsToAddModList  SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element
                  OPTIONAL,  -- Need N
   elementsToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId
                  OPTIONAL,  -- Need N
   ...
}

Element ::=     SEQUENCE {
   elementId        ElementId,
   aField           INTEGER (0..16777215),
   anotherField     OCTET STRING,
   ...
}

ElementId ::=     INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)

maxNrofElements     INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1      INTEGER ::= 49

-- /example/ ASN1STOP


As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER)
that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and
removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here
ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as
well as in the elementsToReleaseList.

Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as ”Need N”. The need code
reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but
rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In other
words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a
previously signalled elementsToAddModList or elementsToReleaseList (which
Need M would imply). The update is always in relation to the UE's internal
configuration.

If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and
ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:

The UE shall:

1> for each ElementId in the elementsToReleaseList,:

2> if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given
ElementId:

3> release the Element from the current UE configuration;

1> for each Element in the elementsToAddModList:

2> if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given
ElementId:

3> modify the configured Element in accordance with the received Element;

2> else:

3> add received Element to the UE configuration.


A.4  Extension of the PDU specifications


A.4.1  General principles to ensure compatibility

It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on
different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In
particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol
extensions:

-  Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).

-  Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should
be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the
handling of the other parts of the message).

-  Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If
used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be
defined.

It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the
logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an
implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which
case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.

The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for
introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is
used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version.
Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number
of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability,
overhead associated with the extension markers. The critical extension
mechanism may also be considered when it is complicated to accommodate the
extensions by means of non-critical extension mechanisms.


A.4.2  Critical extension of messages and fields

The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There
are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer
branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two
values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the
"inner branch" mechanism.

The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
"MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or
"spareX", with the spare values having type NULL. The "-rX-IEs" structures
contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate
release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a
message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the
later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.

The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an
'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain
number of spares:

-  For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted
on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.

-  An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.

-  The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood
that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each
release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare
values). The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based
on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the
message.

-  In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical
extensions are added using the outer branch.

The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension
mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release

-- /example/ ASN1START          -- Original release

RRCMessage ::=               SEQUENCE {
   rrc-TransactionIdentifier        RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
   criticalExtensions           CHOICE {
     c1                    CHOICE{
       rrcMessage-r8              RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
       spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
     },
     criticalExtensionsFuture       SEQUENCE {}
   }
}

-- ASN1STOP


-- /example/ ASN1START          -- Later release

RRCMessage ::=               SEQUENCE {
   rrc-TransactionIdentifier        RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
   criticalExtensions           CHOICE {
     c1                    CHOICE{
       rrcMessage-r8              RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
       rrcMessage-r10             RRCMessage-r10-IEs,
       rrcMessage-r11             RRCMessage-r11-IEs,
       rrcMessage-r14             RRCMessage-r14-IEs
     },
     later               CHOICE {
       c2                    CHOICE{
         rrcMessage-r16             RRCMessage-r16-IEs,
         spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,
         spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
       },
       criticalExtensionsFuture       SEQUENCE {}
     }
   }
}

-- ASN1STOP


It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the
level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically
extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version
may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, EUTRAN is unaware
if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both
versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following
example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing
the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.

-- /example/ ASN1START          -- Original release

RRCMessage ::=               SEQUENCE {
   rrc-TransactionIdentifier        RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
   criticalExtensions           CHOICE {
     c1                    CHOICE{
       rrcMessage-r8              RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
       spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
     },
     criticalExtensionsFuture       SEQUENCE {}
   }
}

RRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
   field1-rN               ENUMERATED {
                         value1, value2, value3, value4}  OPTIONAL,  --

NoField2rN
   nonCriticalExtension         SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP


|Conditional      |Explanation                                                                                 |
|presence         |                                                                                            |

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the
same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to
correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be
introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the
critically extension.


A.4.3  Non-critical extension of messages


A.4.3.1  General principles

The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:

-  When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has
been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in
earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.

-  The extension marker ("...") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length
determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant
is not required:

-  at the end of a message;

-  at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.

-  When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned
parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as
the 'default extension location').

-  It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version
of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest
possible level.

-  In specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group
should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message. <TBD: ref to
seperate example>

-  In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following
higher level in the message should be considered.

-  In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an
IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the
same ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are
intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension
location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are
primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate
levels need not allways be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the
default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1
section. <TBD: ref to seperate example>


A.4.3.2  Further guidelines

Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension
markers:

-  Extension markers within SEQUENCE:

-  Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels.

-  Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several
fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in
complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).

-  Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain
important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one
particular RAT.

-  Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e.
messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat
more carefully.

-  The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together using double brackets.

-  Extension markers within ENUMERATED:

-  Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next
power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that
limit, given that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible
without any error cases.

-  A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new
value, e.g. "value-vXYZ".

-  Extension markers within CHOICE:

-  Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is
not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports
the extended value.

-  A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new
choice value, e.g. "choice-vXYZ".

Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an
OCTET or BIT STRING:

-  When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a "Need" code should not
be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one
extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For
simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a "Need" code when the field
is not actually used either.

Further, more general, guidelines:

-  In case a need code is not provided for a group, a "Need" code is
provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e.
including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to
clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.


A.4.3.3  Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions

The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a
number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension
mechanism is used.

NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n
while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the
release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more
advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.

-- /example/ ASN1START

InformationElement1 ::=      SEQUENCE {
   field1                  ENUMERATED {
                         value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
                         ..., value5-v960 },

                         value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
                         value5-v960, value6-v1170, spare2, spare1, ... },
   field2                  CHOICE {
     field2a                 BOOLEAN,
     field2b                 InformationElement2b,
     field2c-v960            InformationElement2c-r9,
     ...,
     field2d-v12b0              INTEGER (0..63)
   },

R
   ...,
   [[  field3-v1170          InformationElement3-v1170    OPTIONAL -- Need
R
   ]]
}

-- ASN1STOP


Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in
the above example:

–  The InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is
introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of
the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in
which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a
revision of the original field.

–  The value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was
originally defined in the r10 version of field1.

–  Within the critically extended release 10 version of
InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed,
unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g.
the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol
version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is
introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the
InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged
InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.


A.4.3.4  Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:

–  The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.


A.4.3.5  Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
         extension location

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in
case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.


–  ParentIE-WithEM

The IE ParentIE-WithEM is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower
level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs
have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.

The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0
and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level
IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.

   childIE2-WithoutEM           ChildIE2-WithoutEM        OPTIONAL,    --

   ...,
   [[  childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0        ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0    OPTIONAL,
   -- Need N
     childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0        ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0    OPTIONAL
-- Need N
   ]]
}

-- ASN1STOP


Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:

–  The fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional
(depends on what is defined at the next lower level).

–  In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.


–  ChildIE1-WithoutEM

The IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to
control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which
can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The
example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N
to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on
the following assumptions:

–  When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e.
as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this
feature.

–  When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.

–  When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the
signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).

–  When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which
may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover
to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).

The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes,
may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

A.5  Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
         messages

The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier

1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.

2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.

3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.

4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include
an RRC transaction identifier.

5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC
Transaction identifier.


A.6  Guidelines regarding use of need codes

The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for
optional downlink fields:

- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:

- use Need M (=Maintain);

- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:

- use Need R (=Release);

- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does
not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):

- use Need N (=None);

- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above
conditions):

- use Need S (=Specified);

- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text
or in the field description table.


A.7  Guidelines regarding use of conditions

Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which
the following types can be distinguished:

-  CondM: Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is
mandatory present if the same message includes field A and when it is set
value X.

-  CondC: Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be
signalled if field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of
whether field C is present in the same message or previously configured).

The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.
