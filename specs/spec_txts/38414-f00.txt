Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within
the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify
the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG
with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version
number as follows:

  Version x.y.z

  where:

    x  the first digit:

       1  presented to TSG for information;

       2  presented to TSG for approval;

       3  or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

    y  the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
       technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

    z  the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
       incorporated in the document.



1  Scope

The present document specifies the standards for user data transport
protocols and related signalling protocols to establish user plane
transport bearers over the NG interface.

4  Data Link Layer

Any data link protocol that fulfils the requirements toward the upper layer
may be used.


5  NG Interface user plane protocol


5.1  General

Both gNB and ng-eNB can be connected to 5GC over NG interface.

The transport layer for data streams over NG is an IP based Transport. The
following figure shows the transport protocol stacks over NG.

                                    [pic]

        Figure 5.1: Transport network layer for data streams over NG

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [3]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported as
the transport for data streams on the NG interface. The data link layer is
as specified in clause 4.

The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.281 [3]) and
the IP address (source TEID, destination TEID, source IP address,
destination IP address).


5.2  GTP-U

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [3]) protocol shall be used over the NG-U interface
toward the 5GC.


5.3  UDP/IP

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 [4]).

The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.281 [3].

The NG-RAN node and the 5GC shall support fragmentation and assembly of GTP
packets at the IP layer.

The NG-RAN node and the 5GC shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [5]) and/or
IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [6]).

There may be one or several IP addresses in the NG-RAN node and in the 5GC.
The packet processing function in the 5GC shall send downstream packets of
a given PDU Session to the NG-RAN node IP address (received in NGAP)
associated to that particular PDU Session. The packet processing function
in the NG-RAN node shall send upstream packets of a given PDU Session to
the 5GC IP address (received in NGAP) associated to that particular PDU
Session.

The Transport Layer Address signalled in NGAP messages is a bitstring of

  a) 32 bits in case of IPv4 address according to IETF RFC 791 [6]; or

  b) 128 bits in case of IPv6 address according to IETF RFC 2460 [5]; or

  c) 160 bits if both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are signalled, in which case
    the IPv4 address is contained in the first 32 bits.


5.4  Diffserv code point marking

IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 [7]) shall be
supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv code points
shall be configurable by O&M based on 5QI characteristics and other NG-RAN
traffic parameters. Traffic categories are implementation-specific and may
be determined from the application parameters.
