Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the\nControl plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC\nentity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a\ngNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE.\n\nRRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The\nMN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but\nsubsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When\ntransporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE\nconfiguration provided by the SN.\n\nIn EN-DC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. After\ninitial connection establishment MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured\nby the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP. A PDCP version change\n(release of old PDCP and establish of new PDCP) of SRBs can be supported in\neither direction (i.e. from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP or viceversa) via a\nhandover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial\nchange from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without\nmobility, when the network knows there is no UL data in buffer and before\nthe initial security activation. For EN-DC capable UEs, NR PDCP can be\nconfigured for DRBs and SRBs also before EN-DC is configured.\n\nIf the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC and NGEN-DC), the UE can be configured\nto establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be\nsent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be\ntransported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any\ncoordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN\ncan be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured.\n\nSplit SRB is supported for all MR-DC options, allowing duplication of RRC\nPDUs generated by the MN, via the direct path and via the SN.

In case of SCG RLC re-establishment for E-RABs configured\n    with an MN terminated bearer with an SCG RLC bearer for which no bearer\n    type change is performed, the MN provides a new UL GTP TEID to the SN.\n    The SN shall continue sending UL PDCP PDUs to the MN with the previous\n    UL GTP TEID until it re-establishes the RLC and use the new UL GTP TEID\n    after re-establishment. In case of PDCP re-establishment for E-RABs\n    configured with an SN terminated bearer with an MCG RLC bearer for\n    which no bearer type change is performed, the MN provides a new DL GTP\n    TEID to the SN.

The SN responds with the SgNB Modification Request Acknowledge\n    message, which may contain SCG radio resource configuration information\n    within a NR RRC configuration message and data forwarding address\n    information (if applicable).  In case of a PSCell change with security\n    key update, for E-RABs configured with the MN terminated bearer option\n    that require X2-U resources between the MN and the SN, for which no\n    bearer type change is performed, the SN provides a new DL GTP TEID to\n    the MN.

In case of a PSCell change with\n    security key update, for E-RABs configured with the SN terminated\n    bearer option that require X2-U resources between the MN and the SN,\n    for which no bearer type change is performed, the SN provides a new UL\n    GTP TEID to the MN.

The MN initiates the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure,\n    including the NR RRC configuration message. The UE applies the new\n    configuration, synchronizes to the MN (if instructed, in case of intra-\n    MN handover) and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete,\n    including a NR RRC response message, if needed. In case the UE is\n    unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the\n    RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration\n    failure procedure.\n\n  6.

If data forwarding and/or SN security key change needs to be\n    applied, the MN triggers the preparation of the MN initiated SN\n    Modification procedure and provides forwarding address and/or a new SN\n    security key information within the SgNB Modification Request message,\n    respectively.\n\n  NOTE 2:  If only SN security key is provided in step 2, the MN does not\n         need to wait for the reception of step 3 to initiate the RRC\n         connection reconfiguration procedure.\n\n  4.
