Additionally, the network can activate one or several dedicated\nEPS bearer contexts in parallel for PDN connections of IP PDN type.

The relationship between the\nsecurity parameters is defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19].\n\nBefore security can be activated, the MME and the UE need to establish an\nEPS security context. Usually, the EPS security context is created as the\nresult of an EPS authentication procedure between MME and UE.\nAlternatively:\n\n  -  during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode\n    to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security context\n    from a UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was\n    in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or\n\n  -  during CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu\n    mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security\n    context from a CS UMTS security context that has been established while\n    the UE was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode.\n\nThe EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME, when the\nMME initiates a security mode control procedure or during the inter-system\nhandover procedure from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode. The EPS\nsecurity context which has been taken into use by the network most recently\nis called current EPS security context. This current EPS security context\ncan be of type native or mapped, i.e. originating from a native EPS\nsecurity context or mapped EPS security context.\n\nThe key set identifier eKSI is assigned by the MME either during the EPS\nauthentication procedure or, for the mapped EPS security context, during\nthe inter-system handover procedure. The eKSI consists of a value and a\ntype of security context parameter indicating whether an EPS security\ncontext is a native EPS security context or a mapped EPS security context.\nWhen the EPS security context is a native EPS security context, the eKSI\nhas the value of KSIASME, and when the current EPS security context is of\ntype mapped, the eKSI has the value of KSISGSN.\n\nThe EPS security context which is indicated by an eKSI can be taken into\nuse to establish the secure exchange of NAS messages when a new NAS\nsignalling connection is established without executing a new EPS\nauthentication procedure (see subclause\u00a04.4.2.3) or when the MME initiates\na security mode control procedure. For this purpose the initial NAS\nmessages (i.e. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, DETACH\nREQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, and CONTROL PLANE\nSERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an eKSI in\nthe NAS key set identifier IE or the value part of eKSI in the KSI and\nsequence number IE indicating the current EPS security context used to\nintegrity protect the NAS message.\n\nIn the present document, when the UE is required to delete an eKSI, the UE\nshall set the eKSI to the value \"no key is available\" and consider also the\nassociated keys KASME or K'ASME, EPS NAS ciphering key and EPS NAS\nintegrity key invalid (i.e. the EPS security context associated with the\neKSI as no longer valid).\n\n  NOTE:  In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number\n         might be used instead of the term Key Set Identifier (KSI).\n\nThe UE and the MME need to be able to maintain two EPS security contexts\nsimultaneously, i.e. a current EPS security context and a non-current EPS\nsecurity context, since:\n\n  -  after an EPS re-authentication, the UE and the MME can have both a\n    current EPS security context and a non-current EPS security context\n    which has not yet been taken into use (i.e. a partial native EPS\n    security context); and\n\n  -  after an inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to\n    S1 mode, the UE and the MME can have both a mapped EPS security\n    context, which is the current EPS security context, and a non-current\n    native EPS security context that was created during a previous access\n    in S1 mode or S101 mode.\n\nThe number of EPS security contexts that need to be maintained\nsimultaneously by the UE and the MME is limited by the following\nrequirements:\n\n  -  After a successful EPS (re-)authentication, which creates a new\n    partial native EPS security context, the MME and the UE shall delete\n    the non-current EPS security context, if any.\n\n  -  When a partial native EPS security context is taken into use through a\n    security mode control procedure, the MME and the UE shall delete the\n    previously current EPS security context.\n\n  -  When the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null\n    integrity and null ciphering algorithm during an attach procedure for\n    emergency bearer services, or a tracking area updating procedure for a\n    UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services (see\n    subclause\u00a05.4.3.2), the MME and the UE shall delete the previous\n    current EPS security context.\n\n  -  When a new mapped EPS security context or EPS security context created\n    using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm is taken into use\n    during the inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode\n    to S1 mode, the MME and the UE shall not delete the previously current\n    native EPS security context, if any. Instead, the previously current\n    native EPS security context shall become a non-current native EPS\n    security context, and the MME and the UE shall delete any partial\n    native EPS security context.\n\n     If no previously current native EPS security context exists, the MME\n    and the UE shall not delete the partial native EPS security context, if\n    any.\n\n  -  When the MME and the UE derive a new mapped EPS security context\n    during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1\n    mode, the MME and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped EPS\n    security context.\n\n  -  When a non-current full native EPS security context is taken into use\n    by a security mode control procedure, then the MME and the UE shall\n    delete the previously current mapped EPS security context.\n\n  -  When the UE or the MME moves from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED\n    state, if the current EPS security context is a mapped EPS security\n    context and a non-current full native EPS security context exists, then\n    the non-current EPS security context shall become the current EPS\n    security context. Furthermore, the UE and the MME shall delete any\n    mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context.\n\nThe UE shall mark the EPS security context on the USIM or in the non-\nvolatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an attach procedure as\ndescribed in subclause\u00a05.5.1 or when the UE leaves state EMM-DEREGISTERED\nfor any other state except EMM-NULL.\n\nThe UE shall store the current native EPS security context as specified in\nannex\u00a0C and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED\nfrom any other state except EMM-NULL or when the UE aborts the attach\nprocedure without having left EMM-DEREGISTERED.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "UMTS, GSM, EPS, GPRS, stage 3, radio, layer 3, user,equipment, network, LTE"}, {"key": "Establishment of a mapped EPS security context during intersystem", "numbering": "4.4.2.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "4.4.2.2  Establishment of a mapped EPS security context during intersystem\n           handover\n\nIn order for the UE to derive a mapped EPS security context for an inter-\nsystem change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode,\nthe MME shall generate a KSISGSN, create a nonceMME and generate the K'ASME\nusing the created nonceMME as indicated in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19].

How this periodic\n    scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.\n\nIf the the NB-IoT capability is disabled the UE shall re-enable the NB-IoT\ncapability when:\n\n  -  performing a PLMN selection unless the UE has already re-enabled the\n    NB-IoT capability when performing bullets c) or d) above; or\n\n  -  the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.\n\nIf the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message\nincluding both EMM cause #15 \"no suitable cells in tracking area\" and an\nExtended EMM cause IE with value \"NB-IoT not allowed\" after the UE requests\naccess to the NB-IoT, in order to prevent unwanted cell reselection from\nGERAN or UTRAN or E-UTRAN to NB-IoT, the UE may:\n\n  -  disable the NB-IoT capability:\n\n  -  indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the NB-IoT\n    capability; and\n\n  -  memorize the identity of the PLMN where the NB-IoT capability was\n    disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections\n    as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE:  The UE can only disable the NB-IoT capability when in EMM-IDLE\n         mode.\n\nIf the UE is required to disable the NB-IoT capability and select E-UTRAN\nradio access technology, and the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE\nshall locally release the established NAS signalling connection and enter\nthe EMM-IDLE mode before selecting E-UTRAN radio access technology.\n\nAs an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling the NB-\nIoT capability. On expiry of this timer, the UE may enable the NB-IoT\ncapability.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "UMTS, GSM, EPS, GPRS, stage 3, radio, layer 3, user,equipment, network, LTE"}, {"key": "Elementary procedures for EPS mobility management", "numbering": "5", "title_level": 0, "desc": "5  Elementary procedures for EPS mobility management\n\n\n", "Keywords": "UMTS, GSM, EPS, GPRS, stage 3, radio, layer 3, user,equipment, network, LTE"}, {"key": "Overview", "numbering": "5.1", "title_level": 1, "desc": "5.1  Overview\n\n\n", "Keywords": "UMTS, GSM, EPS, GPRS, stage 3, radio, layer 3, user,equipment, network, LTE"}, {"key": "General", "numbering": "5.1.1", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.1.1  General\n\nThis clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for EPS\nservices (EMM) at the radio interface (reference point \"LTE-Uu\").\n\nThe main function of the mobility management sublayer is to support the\nmobility of a user equipment, such as informing the network of its present\nlocation and providing user identity confidentiality.\n\nA further function of the mobility management sublayer is to provide\nconnection management services to the session management (SM) sublayer and\nthe short message services (SMS) entity of the connection management (CM)\nsublayer.\n\nAll the EMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a\nNAS signalling connection has been established between the UE and the\nnetwork.

If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN\nconnection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection\nis supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all\nEPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS\nbearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.\n\nIf the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nREQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in the\nTRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts\nare active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context exists on\nthe network side.\n\nIf the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\nmessage indicates \"periodic updating\", and the UE was previously\nsuccessfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator\npolicies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than\none location area.\n\nThe MME shall indicate \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated\nand ISR activated\" in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply:\n\n  -  the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\n    message indicates \"periodic updating\" and the UE was previously\n    successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and\n\n  -  location area updating for non-EPS services as specified in\n    3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A] is successful.\n\nThe MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic\ntimer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE REQUEST message.\n\nThe MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage only if the T3324 value IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nREQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM.\n\nIf the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the\nT3412extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then\nthe MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing\nthe T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  Besides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local\n         configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account\n         when selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]\n         subclause\u00a04.3.17.3).\n\nIf the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than\ndeactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MME shall\nindicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage that ISR is not activated.\n\nAlso during the tracking area updating procedure without \"active\" flag, if\nthe MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for any reason, the\nMME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by\nincluding the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message.\n\nAlso during the tracking area updating procedure with \"active\" flag, if the\nMME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) associated with control plane\nonly indication locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the\ndeactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context\nstatus IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the\nUE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the\nregistered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as\nspecified in annex\u00a0C.\n\nIf due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE\nis not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for emergency\nbearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nREQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by\ninitiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when the tracking\narea updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the\ntracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME\nlocally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and informs the\nUE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts.\nThe network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer\nservices only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the\nTRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated.\n\nIf a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA\nPDN connection, and if:\n\n  -  a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided\n    by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\n    message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the\n    LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer\n    Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or\n\n  -  no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING\n    AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer,\n\nthen the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with\nthe LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the MME takes one of the following\nactions:\n\n  -  if no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not\n    accept the tracking area update request as specified in\n    subclause\u00a05.5.3.2.5;\n\n  -  if active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA\n    UPDATE REQUEST message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS\n    bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message\n    that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated.\n\nIf a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a\nSIPTO at the local network PDN connection, is accepted by the network, the\nfollowing different cases can be distinguished:\n\n  1) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection\n    with collocated L-GW and if:\n\n    -  a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is\n       provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\n       REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer\n       context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different\n       from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see\n       3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or\n\n    -  no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the\n       TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer,\n\n  2) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection\n    with stand-alone GW and if:\n\n    -  a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the\n       TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the LHN-ID stored in the\n       EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection\n       is different from the provided LHN-ID value (see\n       3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or\n\n    -  no LHN-ID value  is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\n       REQUEST message by the lower layer,\n\nthen the MME takes one of the following actions:\n\n  -  if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining\n    PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is\n    not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon completion\n    of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach\n    type \"re-attach required\" (see subclause\u00a05.5.2.3.1);\n\n  -  if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining\n    PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is\n    supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of\n    the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context\n    deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\"for\n    the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN\n    connection (see subclause 6.4.4.2); and\n\n  -  if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN\n    connection, the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating\n    procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with\n    ESM cause\u00a0#39 \"reactivation requested\"for the default EPS bearer\n    context of each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see\n    subclause\u00a06.4.4.2);\n\nFor a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the\nconditions to deactivate ISR are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10],\nsubclause\u00a04.3.5.6.\n\nFor a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain\ndifferent PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network\noperator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[8B]).\n\nIf the \"active\" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\nmessage and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the\nMME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer\ncontexts. If the \"active\" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nREQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME,\nthe MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS\nbearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control\nplane only indication.\n\nIf the \"signalling active\" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nREQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME,\nthe MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection after\nthe completion of the tracking area updating procedure.\n\nIf the \"active\" flag is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\nmessage and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the\nMME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS\nbearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending\nsignalling. If the \"active\" flag is not included in the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by\nthe MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all\nactive EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established\nwithout Control plane only indication due to downlink pending data or\ndownlink pending signalling.\n\nIf the MME supports NB-S1 mode, Non-IP PDN type, or inter-system change\nwith 5GS, then the MME shall support the extended protocol configuration\noptions IE.\n\nIf the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the\nUE indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE,\nthen the MME shall set the ePCO bit to \"extended protocol configuration\noptions supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING\nAREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in\nthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network decides to\nrestrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set\nthe RestrictEC bit to \"Use of enhanced coverage is restricted\" in the EPS\nnetwork feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nThe MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in the\nTRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message for each established EPS bearer context\nusing control plane CIoT EPS optimisation.\n\nIf the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer,\nand the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of\nuser data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value\nIE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the TRACKING\nAREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict the use of\ndual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the\nRestrictDCNR bit to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted\" in the\nEPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not\nallowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall set the redir-policy bit to\n\"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" in the Network policy IE of\nthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap time\nvalue is available in the EMM context, the MME may include the T3447 value\nIE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage.\n\nIf the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer\ncontexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number of\n15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then\nthe MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to \"Signalling for a maximum number of\n15 EPS bearer contexts supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of\nthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in\nthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering\nkey data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall include\nthe ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nUpon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop\ntimer T3430, reset the service request attempt counter, tracking area\nupdating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS update\nstatus to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use\nthis GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall store the\nnew GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI\nlist in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the\nnew TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE\nshall consider the old TAI list as valid.\n\nIf the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for\nwhich a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter\nis maintained (see subclause\u00a05.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these\ncounters. If the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid\nfor GPRS services\", then the UE shall reset this counter.\n\nIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended\nvalue IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic\ntracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\ncontains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall\nuse value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412).\nIf neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE\nshall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or\nTRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.\n\nIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE,\nthen the UE shall use the timer value for T3324 as specified in\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], subclause\u00a04.7.2.8.\n\nIf the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE\nmode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode\nand the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,\nthe UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message.\n\nIf an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts\nlocally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which\nare active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a\ndefault EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context\nstatus IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this\ndefault bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in\nthe UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated\nto the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-\npeer ESM signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency\nbearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached\nfor emergency bearer services only. If the default bearer is associated\nwith the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-\nREGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the\nUE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN\nconnection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM\nsignalling to the UE.\n\nIf an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE\nACCEPT message, the UE may choose to ignore all those EPS bearers which are\nindicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the UE.\n\nThe MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code\n(MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if\nthere is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the\nUE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of\n\"forbidden PLMNs\" or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\". If\nthe UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN\nconnection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove\nfrom the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of\nforbidden PLMNs or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" when\nthe PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition,\nthe UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN\nthat sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of\nthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list.\n\nIf the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and if the PLMN\nidentity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of \"forbidden\nPLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\", any such PLMN\nidentity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s).\n\nThe network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING\nAREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is attached for\nemergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update\nresult IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not\nactivated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains:\n\n  i) no indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to\n    \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or\n    T3323, if running;\n\n  ii)  an indication that ISR is activated, then:\n\n    -  if the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice\n       termination as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], annex\u00a0P.5, the UE\n       shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area\n       update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;\n\n    -  if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to\n       a change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE\n       shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area\n       update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;\n\n    -  if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to\n       a change in the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for\n       E-UTRAN, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the\n       periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; or\n\n    -  the UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid\n       and registered with the network. If the TIN currently indicates \"P-\n       TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running or\n       is deactivated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\". If\n       the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area\n       update timer T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to\n       \"GUTI\".\n\nThe network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as\nIMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency\nbearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature\nsupport information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the\nIMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services\nindicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the\nIMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[8A], subclause\u00a07.2a and subclause\u00a07.2b, when selecting the\naccess domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency\ncall, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session\nindicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the\naccess domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS\nsession indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS\nsessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent\nEPS bearer context. When the UE determines via the emergency bearer\nservices indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer\nservices in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency\nEPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated with that context.\nIn a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS)\nshall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by\nthe UE's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified\nin 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.171\u00a0[13C].\n\nIf the RestrictDCNR bit is set to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is\nrestricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual\nconnectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers.\n\nIf the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not\nallowed\" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT\nmessage, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to\nGERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\"\nand indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell\nis not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to\nGERAN allowed\" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the TRACKING\nAREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on\nunsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured\nredirection to GERAN allowed\" and indicate to the lower layers that\nunsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall set the\nnetwork policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to \"Unsecured redirection\nto GERAN not allowed\" and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the\nfollowing events occurs:\n\n  -  the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in\n    a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last\n    successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure;\n\n  -  the UE is switched on; or\n\n  -  the UICC containing the USIM is removed.\n\nIf the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to manual\nCSG selection and receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the\nUE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE\nshall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where\nthe UE has sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in\nthe Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated\nPLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if\nprovided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is\npresent in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.\n\nIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE shall\nreturn a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to acknowledge\nthe received GUTI.\n\nIf the UE which was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS\nservices receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with EPS update\nresult IE indicating \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated\nand ISR activated\" as the response of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST\nmessage with EPS update type IE indicating \"periodic updating\", the UE\nshall behave as follows:\n\n  -  If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is\n    not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly.\n\n  -  If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE\n    shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity.

The first default EPS bearer context, however, can\nbe activated during the EPS attach procedure (see subclause\u00a04.2). Once the\nUE is successfully attached, and the first default EPS bearer context has\nbeen activated during or after the attach procedure, the UE can request the\nMME to set up connections to additional PDNs. For each additional\nconnection, the MME will activate a separate default EPS bearer context. A\ndefault EPS bearer context remains activated throughout the lifetime of the\nconnection to the PDN.\n\nA dedicated EPS bearer context is always linked to a default EPS bearer\ncontext and represents additional EPS bearer resources between the UE and\nthe PDN. The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS bearer\ncontexts together with the activation of the default EPS bearer context or\nat any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer context remains\nactivated. However, the network shall not initiate a dedicated bearer\ncontext activation procedure for established PDN connection(s) of \"non IP\"\nPDN type.\n\nDefault and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified.

If the network indicates that a back-off timer for the PDN\nconnectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it\nremains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  This means the back-off timer can still be running or be\n         deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN\n         combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs\n         inter-system change back from A/Gb or Iu mode to S1 mode. Thus the\n         UE can still be prevented from sending another PDN CONNECTIVITY\n         REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.\n\nIf the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY\nREQUEST was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall ignore the\nRe-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT,\nif any, and proceed as specified in subclause\u00a05.5.1.2.6, item\u00a0d.\n\nIf the back-off timer is started upon receipt of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT\n(i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a configured value is\navailable or the default value is used as explained above) or the back-off\ntimer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:\n\n  1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message\n    for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running\n    and is not deactivated for the PDN connectivity procedure and the\n    combination of new PLMN and APN;\n\n     Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #8\n    \"operator determined barring\", #27 \"missing or unknown APN\", #32\n    \"service option not supported\" or #33 \"requested service option not\n    subscribed\", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE,\n    the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY\n    REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same\n    PDN type, or the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN\n    CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message included in an ATTACH REQUEST message\n    without an APN using the same PDN type if the UE did not provide any\n    APN in the PDN connectivity procedure, if the UE is registered to a new\n    PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.\n\n  2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to\n    indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, or the UE\n    ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer\n    value IE is not included, then:\n\n    -  if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the\n       EHPLMN list, the UE shall apply the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange\n       value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG\n       as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, to determine\n       whether the UE may attempt a PDP context activation procedure for the\n       same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode; and\n\n    -  if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within\n       the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in\n       3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] is not available and the value for inter-system\n       change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE\n       behaviour regarding a PDP context activation procedure for the same\n       PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode is unspecified; and\n\n  3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-\n    attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the\n    timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each\n    combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE\n    shall start a back-off timer for the PDP connectivity procedure with\n    the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-\n    off timer as follows:\n\n    -  If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-\n       attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, the UE shall start or\n       deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and\n\n    -  otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for\n       A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.\n\nIf the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or\ndeactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT\nREJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) and the network indicated that re-\nattempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent\nthe UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the\nsame APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated\nthat re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any PDN\nCONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-\nsystem change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or\nthe USIM is removed.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the\n         required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific\n         implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to\n         use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific\n         timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer\n         or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off\n         timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off timer is\n         stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.\n\nWhen the back-off timer is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is\nallowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN connectivity procedure if\nthe procedure is for emergency bearer services.\n\nIf the ESM cause value is #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type\nIPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\" or #58 \"PDN type non\nIP only allowed\", the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE provided\nby the network, if any. The UE shall not automatically send another PDN\nCONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using\nthe same PDN type until any of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n\n  -  the UE is registered to a new PLMN, and either the network did not\n    include a Re-attempt indicator IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT\n    message or the Re-attempt indicator IE included in the message\n    indicated that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed;\n\n  -  the UE is registered to a new PLMN which was not in the list of\n    equivalent PLMNs at the time when the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message\n    was received;\n\n  -  the PDN type which is used to access to the APN is changed;\n\n  -  the UE is switched off; or\n\n  -  the USIM is removed.\n\nFor the ESM cause values #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type\nIPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\" and #58 \"PDN type\nnon IP only allowed\", the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the\nRe-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.\n\nFurthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #50 \"PDN\ntype IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type\nIPv4v6 only allowed\" and #58 \"PDN type non IP only allowed\", if the network\ndoes not include a Re-attempt indicator IE the UE may decide not to\nautomatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same\nAPN that was sent by the UE using the same PDN type, if the UE is\nregistered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a\n         specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.\n\nIf the ESM cause value is #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\", the\nUE shall determine the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1\nmode (see subclause\u00a06.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer contexts it\nhas. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt\nindicator IE provided by the network, if any.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS\n         bearer contexts, the number of active EPS bearer contexts that the\n         UE has when ESM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum\n         number of EPS bearer contexts reached in the network.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  When the network supports emergency bearer services, it is not\n         expected that ESM cause #65 is returned by the network when the UE\n         requests a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.\n\nThe PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to the\nPLMN in which the ESM cause #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\" is\nreceived. When the UE is switched off, when the USIM is removed, or when\nthere is a change in the value indicated by the network in the 15 bearers\nbit of the EPS network feature support IE, the UE shall clear all previous\ndeterminations representing PLMNs maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in\nS1 mode. Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear\nprevious determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number(s) of EPS\nbearer contexts in S1 mode.\n\nIf the ESM cause value is #66 \"requested APN not supported in current RAT\nand PLMN combination\", the UE shall take different actions depending on the\nBack-off timer value IE and the Re-attempt indicator IE optionally\nincluded:\n\n  1) If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-\n    off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt indicator\n    IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE is included\n    indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE\n    shall not initiate an attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY\n    REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until\n    the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;\n\n  2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-\n    off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is\n    included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not\n    allowed, the UE shall not initiate an attach procedure or send a PDN\n    CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in the list\n    of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM\n    is removed;\n\n  3) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone and the\n    Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different\n    actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer\n    value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11\u00a0\u2013\u00a015 in selected\n    PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause\u00a06.3.6):\n\n    i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE\n       shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-\n       off timer value IE for the PLMN and APN combination and shall not\n       send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST for the same APN in the current\n       PLMN in S1 mode until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched\n       off or the USIM is removed;\n\n    ii)  if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the\n       UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the\n       same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off\n       or the USIM is removed;

The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation,\n       if the IE has format T, TV, TLV or TLV-E.

sent on.\n\nThe UE network capability information element is coded as shown in\nfigure\u00a09.9.3.34.1 and table\u00a09.9.3.34.1.\n\nThe UE network capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum\nlength of 4 octets and a maximum length of 15 octets.\n\n  NOTE:  The requirements for the support of UMTS security algorithms in\n         the UE are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.102\u00a0[18], and the requirements\n         for the support of EPS security algorithms in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19].\n\n\n\n|8
